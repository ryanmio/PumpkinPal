# Pumpkin OTT Weight Calculator App

## 🚧 Project Status: Early Development

Welcome to my Pumpkin OTT Weight Calculator App repository! This app is in its early stages of development. 

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly web-based application for giant pumpkin growers to calculate and track the weight of their pumpkins using the OTT method. The app's primary users are hobbyists in the giant pumpkin growing community.

### Core Features (Planned)

1. **Weight Calculation:** The application will utilize a chatbot to interact with users for the measurements. In addition, it will allow an option for input fields to directly input measurements. The application will then calculate the OTT weight, and confirm the pumpkin ID.

2. **Profile and Progress Tracking:** Users will be able to create profiles and save their pumpkin's weight and measurements for tracking progress over time.

### Optional Features (Planned)

1. **Alerts/Notifications:** The app will be designed to send notifications/alerts to remind users to take measurements on a schedule.

2. **Expansion to Other Platforms:** While the primary platform is the web, the design will accommodate expansion into other platforms, such as a Chrome extension, a text messaging bot, etc.

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

1. **Technology Stack:** The application will leverage the power of the React library for building the user interface. The backend will be handled by Firebase Firestore for storing user data and managing user authentication.

2. **Mobile Responsiveness:** The web application will be designed to be responsive and provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. **Security:** As user data will be stored, the application will follow best security practices to protect user information.
