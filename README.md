# Pumpkin OTT Weight Calculator App

## 🚧 Project Status: Early Development

Welcome to my Pumpkin OTT Weight Calculator App repository! This app is in its early stages of development. 

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly, open-source application for competitive pumpkin growers to calculate and track the weight of their pumpkins using the OTT method. The app's primary users are hobbyists in the giant pumpkin growing community.

### Core Features

1. **Weight Calculation:** The app calculates the OTT weight and stores the data in Firestore.

2. **Dashboard:** Users can see an overview of their pumpkins and all the data they have collected.

### Planned Features

1. **Scheduled Notifications:** The app will allow growers to configure notifications/alerts to remind them to take measurements on a set schedule.

2. **Text and Email support:** I would like to explore the possibility of allowing users to send and email or text with their OTT measurements to the app, which would log the data to their profile.
   
## 🛠️ Technical Details

1. **Technology Stack:** The front end is built with React and Tailwind CSS. The backend uses Firebase for storing user data and managing user authentication.

2. **Mobile First:** The app is designed to be responsive and provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices, while allowing quick and easy mobile functionality for taking measurements in the field.
